<p>My best Kaggle submission in the home credit risk competition had a score of 0.725. For this submission, I used the glm (logistic regression) model and fit the model using the train data set with only the variables OWN_CAR_AGE, DAYS_ID_PUBLISH, AMT_ANNUITY, DAYS_BIRTH, EXT_SOURCE_3, EXT_SOURCE_1, EXT_SOURCE_2, EXT_SOURCE_1, DAYS_BIRTH, AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, DAYS_LAST_PHONE_CHANGE, CODE_GENDER, AMT_CREDIT, AMT_GOODS_PRICE. I filled in the NA values in the columns by creating a function that could replace these missing values with the median of the column. I then used my fit to predict values.I tested the accuracy of my predictions by creating a separate train and test dataset from the train data and then calculating the AUC.</p>
